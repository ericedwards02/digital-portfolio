## founding fullstack engineer @ regulatis

<br />

I'm currently with an ESG-Compliance startup based based in Berkeley called Regulatis as a
founding fullstack engineer. I've worked on major style refactoring projects, and worked with
a team to quickly iterate on new features in a quickly changing environment.
I've participated in daily standup meetings, and collaborate with an amazing team,
all focused on building a new and exciting product. I primarily work with React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Postgres for most tasks.
