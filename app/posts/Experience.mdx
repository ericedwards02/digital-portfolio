## Education

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Oregon in December, 2024.
I spent one year at Brigham Young University in Utah, also studying Computer Science.

## Coursework
**Databases** <br />
My databases course I took entailed a couple lectures on introductory relational algebra and SQL-like syntax, but mostly went
in depth on systems-level implementation, learning about various data structures and concurrency protocols used by modern databases.
This included concepts like B+ trees, indexes, skip lists, LSM trees, bloom filters, two-phase-locking, shadow paging, timestamp-based
concurrency control, and other related concepts. My group project, an implementation of a Lineage-based columnar storage DBMS, was implemented
entirely in Python3. I devised and implemented a B+ tree index that enabled in-tree versioning based off of a structure that allowed linked-list-like
chaining between leaves in the B+ tree.

**Software Development** <br />
This class was a good introduction to microservice-based architecture, and web-dev techniques and concepts that I was able to build on later.
This included things like basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. The projects in the class also required me to familiarize myself with
NoSQL-style databases like MongoDB, and technologies like Docker to run each element of the end program in a private container, then coalesce
with docker-compose.
